# AutocompleteUsingTrie
In this project, I worked on the problem of storing a set of n words (also called keys) in a tree data structure, and a method for efficiently finding all the words that contain a given prefix. By word or key here, we just mean a string formed from some set of ASCII characters. (If you are unfamiliar with ASCII, see http://www.asciitable.com/. ASCII encodes text using one byte or 8 bits per character.) You should be familiar with the above problem through the autocomplete feature found on some cell phones, web forms, Eclipse. For instance, if you type in â€œaar", then autocomplete may suggest aardvark, aardvarks, aardwolf, aardwolves, aargh.
